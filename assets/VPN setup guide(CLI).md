# GoodAccess VPN Setup Guide (CLI)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and connect to GoodAccess VPN on a Linux machine using the command-line interface (CLI).

---

## Step 1: Receive VPN Credentials and Setup Files

You will receive the following via a secure communication channel (e.g., email):
- VPN **username** and **password**
- A setup file (typically in `.zip` format)

---

## Step 2: Unzip the Setup File

1. Locate the received `.zip` file.
2. Extract its contents:
   ```sh
   unzip <setup_file>.zip
   ```
3. Move the `.ovpn` file to the correct directory:
   ```sh
   mv <your_config>.ovpn assets/openvpn_configs/good_access
   ```
4. Open the `.ovpn` file and verify that the following line exists:
   ```
   auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/credentials
   ```
   - If it does not exist, **manually add it** after `auth-user-pass`.

## Step 3: Establish a New VPN Connection

To initiate a VPN connection, run:
```sh
sh envsetup_scripts/setup_vpntunnel.sh -d <host_index> -n
```
Where `<host_index>` is your institute's name. For the ODELIA project, choose from:
- TUD
- Ribera
- VHIO
- Radboud
- UKA
- UMCU
- MHA
- Cambridge
- USZ
- MEVIS

You will be prompted to enter the **username** and **password** provided by TUD.

---

## Step 4: Verify VPN Connection

To confirm that you are connected, check your IP address:
```sh
hostname -I
```
You should see an IP in the range **172.24.4.xx/22**.

---

## Step 5: Reconnect to VPN

If your machine restarts or loses connection, reconnect by running:
```sh
sh envsetup_scripts/setup_vpntunnel.sh
```

The `.ovpn` file assigned to you by TUD is required for re-establishing the connection.

## Step 6: Troubleshooting â€” Disconnecting Existing VPN Connections

Some users have experienced that connecting to GoodAccess **disconnects an existing VPN or ssh connection**.
This may happen because OpenVPN is configured to redirect all network traffic through the GoodAccess tunnel, which overrides your local or other VPN routes and may make the machine inaccessible in its local network.

If this occurs, you can prevent the redirection by starting OpenVPN with:
```sh
openvpn --config <your_config>.ovpn --pull-filter ignore redirect-gateway
```
This tells the OpenVPN client **not** to override your default gateway, allowing your other VPN or ssh connection to remain active.

> **Note:** This behavior was observed by Aitor and Ole after certain OpenVPN updates. The above command has been effective in resolving the issue.
